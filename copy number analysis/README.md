# Copy Number Analysis

## Use:
* **extract_ichor_info.py**: This script converts the output generated by ichor into a table containing the information of "SampleName", "TumorFraction", "Ploidy", "SubcloneFraction", "SubcloneGenomeFraction", "FractionCNASubclonal" for all the samples. Where the input folder contains all files *.params.txt (output generated by ichorCNA), and in the  table, you put the name you want. 
  ```
  python3 extract_ichor_info.py input_folder/ paht/to/table.csv
  ```
* **correlation.R**: This script performs the Pearson correlation test and plot it for tumor fraction and also for bins. It needs the *.cna.seg files generated by ichorCNA and also, a table containing the tumor fraction with their respective ID.

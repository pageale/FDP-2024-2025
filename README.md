# MULTI-DIMENSIONAL COMPARISON OF CELL-FREE DNA MOLECULAR SIGNATURES USING SHORT AND LONG READ SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES IN CLINICAL APPLICATIONS

## Overview

This repository contains the code, workflows and data processing pipelines developed for my thesis project, which focuses on the multi-dimensional characterization of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using both short-read and long-read sequencing technologies in clinical applications.

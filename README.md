# MULTI-DIMENSIONAL COMPARISON OF CELL-FREE DNA MOLECULAR SIGNATURES USING SHORT AND LONG READ SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES IN CLINICAL APPLICATIONS

## Overview

This repository contains the code, workflows and data processing pipelines developed for my thesis project, which focuses on the multi-dimensional characterization of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using both short-read and long-read sequencing technologies in clinical applications. 

## Repository Structure
1. Data processing: In this folder, you will find the scripts and pipelines used for the pre-processing of raw data (FASTQ reads for Illumina and uBAM for Nanopore), downsampling and other general codes.
2. Fragment analysis: This folder contains the code used for the fragment size obtention and files manipulation to generate the plots for fragmentomics comparison.
3. Copy number analysis: Here you will find the copy used to generate the statistical analyiss and plots.
